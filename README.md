### Motivation

As a die hard enthusiast of custom mechanical keyboards I built this application to learn about redux-saga and reselect. I implemented user authentication and authorization via Firebase Oauth.

I wanted to learn how to use memoized selectors via reselect in order to improve performance in React / Redux applications.  In addition to selectors, I also wanted to learn in tandem how to use redux-saga to improve Reacts rendering performance by being able to selectively re-render component trees versus more traditional methods such as redux-thunk.

Users have access to their own shopping cart and can mock checkout with fake stripe credentials.
